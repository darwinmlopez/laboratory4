# Laboratory 4



[Map with tilesets](/Users/darwinlopez/Desktop/laboratory4/index.html)

# In the website you will see four tilesets each showing seattle with a theme or different perspective. The main point of the entire website is for people to use public recousrces, especially UW students. 

![Tileset one](/Users/darwinlopez/Desktop/laboratory4/assets/Satelite)
# The first tileset shows a satelite map of Seattle. This is a way people can reference themselves as it is what most people are use to seeing. 

![Tileset two](/Users/darwinlopez/Desktop/laboratory4/assets/monochrome/3/1/2.png)
# The second map is a monochrome tileset and is the basemap for tilesets three and four. 

![Tileset three](/Users/darwinlopez/Desktop/laboratory4/assets/green_lava/3/1/2.png)
#  Tileset three shows Seattle and the public parks, even through this is titled green lava it is not entily the point. It is meant as a form for people to see parks nearby where they live. 

![Tileset four](/Users/darwinlopez/Desktop/laboratory4/assets/public_wifi)
# Tileset four shows the public wifi locations. mainly this has to do with locations that are public libraries. I have met many UW commuters that find it hard to sudy at home but also stuggle to commute to UW. This allows them to find a library near them.
