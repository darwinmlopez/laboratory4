# [Map with tilesets]('http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html')
In the website you will see four tilesets each showing seattle with a theme or different perspective. The main point of the entire website is for people to use public recousrces, especially UW students. 

# ![Tileset one]('/Users/darwinlopez/Documents/GEOG_458/laboratory4/assets/satellite/7/20/44.png')
The first tileset shows a satelite map of Seattle. This is a way people can reference themselves as it is what most people are use to seeing. 

# ![Tileset two]('/Users/darwinlopez/Documents/GEOG_458/laboratory4/assets/uw_theme/7/20/44.png')
The second map is a UW tileset and is the basemap for tilesets three and four. 

# ![Tileset three]('/Users/darwinlopez/Documents/GEOG_458/laboratory4/assets/green_lava/7/20/44.png')
Tileset three shows Seattle and the public parks, even through this is titled green lava it is not entily the point. It is meant as a form for people to see parks nearby where they live. 

# ![Tileset four]('/Users/darwinlopez/Documents/GEOG_458/laboratory4/assets/public_wifi/7/20/44.png')
Tileset four shows the public wifi locations. mainly this has to do with locations that are public libraries. I have met many UW commuters that find it hard to sudy at home but also stuggle to commute to UW. This allows them to find a library near them.
